# 🎮 Arcademia

Code. Play. Learn.

Arcademia is an educational arcade platform that teaches children fundamental coding concepts through interactive gameplay. Designed to run offline on a custom-built arcade machine, Arcademia combines fun and learning to make programming logic engaging and accessible for all learners.

### 🚀 About the Project

Arcademia was developed to address the growing need for interactive and affordable coding education. Many schools lack access to reliable internet or modern computing resources, which limits exposure to hands-on coding.
Arcademia provides a self-contained, offline arcade system that introduces programming concepts through visual block-based puzzles.

Learners control an in-game character by arranging coding blocks such as movement, actions, loops, and conditionals. This approach turns programming logic into a game, helping students understand how code structure translates into behavior.

### 🧩 Key Features

Offline Operation – No internet required. Runs entirely on local hardware.

Interactive Gameplay – Use a joystick and buttons to create code sequences.

Real-Time Feedback – See your code come to life instantly.

Teacher Dashboard – Create, manage, and monitor student profiles.

Five Progressive Coding Levels – Introduces sequencing, actions, loops, and conditionals step by step.

Accessible Design – Ideal for classrooms, learning centers, and young beginners.

### 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

The Open Map is the main hub where players explore and access themed coding challenges.
Each glowing icon represents a level that teaches a new programming concept.

Gameplay Steps:

Arrange coding blocks in the correct sequence.

Add, delete, or rearrange blocks as needed.

Press Run Sequence to execute the commands.

Modify and retry until the correct result is achieved.

Earn up to 3 stars for efficient, error-free solutions.

### 🌾 Levels Overview
🌊 River Level

Learn the basics of sequencing by crossing a river using movement blocks. Players must plan each move carefully to step on every stone.

🚜 Tractor Level

Reinforce sequencing logic by harvesting all the crops in straight lines. Encourages precision and step-by-step thinking.

🐔 Barn Level

Introduce action blocks like “Pick Up” and “Feed Chicken.” Students learn how to combine sequences with actions. Includes helpful error messages for debugging.

🌼 Garden Level

Explore loops and conditionals by watering plants or planting new ones. Loops make code efficient, while conditionals teach decision-making.

🐄 Cow Level

The final challenge combines loops and nested conditionals. Players whistle to call animals and must open the gate only for cows — reinforcing all previously learned skills.

👩‍🏫 Teacher Mode

Teachers can:

Create, edit, and delete student profiles.

Assign avatars and manage progress.

View scores and completion times for performance tracking.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

Arcademia teaches students to:

Understand sequencing, loops, and conditionals.

Develop logical and computational thinking.

Debug and optimize solutions.

Learn coding fundamentals in a fun, engaging environment.
