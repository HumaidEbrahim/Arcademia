# Arcademia

This innovative arcade-based learning platform, developed by CMPG323 students and their 
project manager, promotes computational thinking and introduces coding fundamentals to 
young learners engagingly and interactively.  
Arcademia provides a fun, game-based environment where students learn programming logic by 
arranging visual code blocks to control a game character.
Through gameplay, children learn essential coding principles, including sequencing, loops, and 
conditionals. Teachers can provide guidance as learners improve.
